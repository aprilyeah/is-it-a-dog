The next layer is a hidden dense layer of 32 nodes using an activation of reLU. After that is a MaxPooling2D layer, followed by another reLU activation layer with 64 nodes (these two layers are repeated again). Then there is a flatten layer, another reLU layer with 64 nodes, and finally a dense layer with 1 node. \n",

    "I picked the Binary Cross-entropy loss because we are dealing with two labels: dog or not dog, which I converted to 1 and 0 respectively. \n",

    "For the optimiser, I picked Adam with a learning rate of 0.00003. This is because Adam is a stochastic gradient descent method that is based on adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments. I initially started with a learning rate of 0.1 but realised this was too large and did not produce accurate results, so I ended up adjusting to a much smaller learning rate."
